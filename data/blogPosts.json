That changed when I started building a small utility to handle GPT calls—something I’d been re-implementing in multiple .NET projects. One day, it hit me: if this code saves me time, why not polish it up and publish it so other C# developers can benefit too?"

That’s when I realized I could centralize everything under one library."

The biggest challenge here was ensuring I didn’t blow through token limits or jam everything into memory if someone decided to have a marathon chat session with GPT-4."

I also implemented optional proxy settings, so if you’re behind a corporate proxy, you can still connect to the OpenAI endpoints without wrestling with custom code. Those might sound like minor details, but they end up being critical in real production settings."
