That changed when I started building a small utility to handle GPT calls—something I’d been re-implementing in multiple .NET projects. One day, it hit me: if this code saves me time, why not polish it up and publish it so other C# developers can benefit too?"

That’s when I realized I could centralize everything under one library."

Once I decided this could be bigger than a local script, I refactored it into a dedicated project. Creating a separate class library forced me to think about the public API: which methods did I really want to expose, and how would users configure them?"

Real-world AI projects often require ongoing chat contexts—like a Q&A bot that “remembers” what you asked two questions ago. So I built in multi-turn conversation support, letting developers store previous messages and maintain context for each user session. The biggest challenge here was ensuring I didn’t blow through token limits or jam everything into memory if someone decided to have a marathon chat session with GPT-4."

So, I introduced configurable retry logic with exponential backoff—helpful for those random 503 errors or rate-limit issues. I also implemented optional proxy settings, so if you’re behind a corporate proxy, you can still connect to the OpenAI endpoints without wrestling with custom code. Those might sound like minor details, but they end up being critical in real production settings."
