That changed when I started building a small utility to handle GPT calls—something I’d been re-implementing in multiple .NET projects. One day, it hit me: if this code saves me time, why not polish it up and publish it so other C# developers can benefit too?"

Each time, I ended up writing (and rewriting) the same logic: handling prompts, managing token limits, dealing with timeouts. Eventually, I started questioning why I was duplicating so much code. That’s when I realized I could centralize everything under one library."

            "type": "paragraph",
            "text": "I wanted the final result to be straightforward. The developer in me didn’t want to read 100 pages of docs just to get a simple GPT response. So, I made sure the library required minimal configuration while remaining flexible for more advanced use cases. This meant focusing on clean architecture, sensible defaults, and robust error handling."

Once I decided this could be bigger than a local script, I refactored it into a dedicated project. Creating a separate class library forced me to think about the public API: which methods did I really want to expose, and how would users configure them?"

This pattern ended up being a lifesaver; when I eventually added features like multi-turn conversations, I could just slot them into the existing config structure without breaking older code."

            "text": "I knew from personal experience that single prompts only go so far. Real-world AI projects often require ongoing chat contexts—like a Q&A bot that “remembers” what you asked two questions ago. So I built in multi-turn conversation support, letting developers store previous messages and maintain context for each user session. The biggest challenge here was ensuring I didn’t blow through token limits or jam everything into memory if someone decided to have a marathon chat session with GPT-4."

So, I introduced configurable retry logic with exponential backoff—helpful for those random 503 errors or rate-limit issues. I also implemented optional proxy settings, so if you’re behind a corporate proxy, you can still connect to the OpenAI endpoints without wrestling with custom code. Those might sound like minor details, but they end up being critical in real production settings."

I spent a fair amount of time in the README explaining each configuration field, demonstrating sample calls, and outlining edge cases. In the process, I found and fixed small inconsistencies—like mismatched method names and optional parameters that weren’t actually optional. Writing docs is a great way to see your code through a fresh lens."

There’s a sense of vulnerability in uploading a package for the world to see—what if there’s a hidden bug or a glaring oversight?
